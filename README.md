# HoloQ — Holographic Quantum Mind Maps

> **Tagline**: Encode knowledge as *quantum holograms*: boundary states sculpt a latent “bulk” geometry for controllable, quantum‑native reasoning and generation.

## 🧠 Concept (TL;DR)

* Treat a knowledge structure (text, graphs, sensor fusion) as a **boundary state** $\partial\mathcal{M}$.
* Learn a **bulk latent geometry** (hyperbolic/Poincaré), where distances reflect semantic & causal structure.
* Use **hybrid quantum circuits** to: (1) *encode* boundary data into quantum states, (2) *propagate* via trainable unitaries that respect negative curvature priors, and (3) *read out* with measurements that act like holographic decoding.
* Aim: **steerable embeddings** (interpretable latent controls) + **noise‑aware training** that is robust on NISQ.

This repo is an MVP research scaffold to iterate quickly: small examples, simple circuits, rigorous evaluation.
